    <h1>Abstract</h1>

    <p> Housing issues based on racial disparities and income inequality continue to rise in Boston.
        In particular, The American City Coalition (TACC) has identified Dorchester, Roxbury, Downtown Boston,
        and South Boston Waterfront as areas of interest. TACC is a non-profit innovative consultancy organization based in
         the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury, grounded in an inclusive, comprehensive, and collaborative approach to
        neighborhood revitalization. <br/>

        <br/> Our mission was to display Boston housing data relating to racial demographics, income distribution, and housing type.
        These graphs are intended to provide TACC and their partners with an overview of Dorchester, Roxbury, South Boston Waterfront, and
        Downtown Boston. We hope these graphs are found to be a concise display of the given, aggregated data. These visualizations
        are expected to be used for internal distribution and communication within TACC and between TACC and relevant partners.<br/>

        <br/> <h1>Visualization Explanation</h1>

        We propose the visualization above to display this data. The pie charts display the racial breakup in our
        4 neighborhoods of interest. We decided to display the piecharts in a bubble chart format, such that the
        area of each pie chart is determined by the population size. By displaying population size by area instead of
        by radius, we are able to address a potential Lie Factor issue. Additionally, we have a legend on the right-hand slide
        and a tooltip enabled such that percentages are easily found through mouse hover. We hope this pie chart is able to address TACC's
        need to display racial group data for their neighborhoods of interest. <br/>

        <br/> To continue investigating the housing disparities between the neighborhoods, we also created a histogram
        to display the income distribution of each neighborhood. The user is able to view each of the histograms by
        clicking on the corresponding pie chart. For furthur insight, the user is able to hover above each bar to find
        the numeric data. This histogram, enabled with linking, is able to present income distribution information in
        tandem with racial and population data. <br/>

        <br/> Finally, we created a stacked bar chart in the lower right hand corner to display information relating to
        homeownership type. This information is relevant to see in relationt to racial group and income distribution data. The
        stacked bar chart is able to reveal more information through a tooltip mousehover. <br/>

        <br/> All 3 of these visualizations work together to display various characteristics of 4 different neighborhoods in
        Boston. The user is able to see general trends in income distribution, racial breakup, and housing ownership. We believe
        this visualization thus addresses our Analyze/High-Level Task of 'Present'.
